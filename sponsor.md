title: Become a sponsor

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You've probably ended up here because a link somewhere still points to this page. For a while I was an independent full-time open source developer. On this page I was asking people who used one of my projects to fund development by becoming a sponsor.

In June 2022 I was hired by Thunderbird to turn [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/) into [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net/) on Android. Since I'm now getting paid a salary, I'm not asking you to support me directly. However, the Thunderbird project is funded by user donations. So if you like the work I'm doing, please [donate to Thunderbird](https://mzla.link/k9-give).

If you're not here because you're using K-9 Mail/Thunderbird, please consider supporting other open source projects. You can find a list of projects and individuals looking for donations here: [https://liberapay.com/explore/](https://liberapay.com/explore/)
