## Why?

I am a big fan of [Free/Libre and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). 
As a developer I very much value that it allows me to freely use and if necessary modify software written by others. 
Since I benefit so much from work people have made available under an open source license it seems only fair that I do 
the same.

I want everyone to be able to use my software, not only those who can pay for it. That's why all of the open source 
software I create is available free of charge.

However, open source developers still need to make a living. So if you use one of my projects and can afford it, please
consider becoming a sponsor. My goal is to be able to work on these projects full-time.

For a list of most of my open source contributions check out [cketti on GitHub](https://github.com/cketti).

## How?

There are multiple options to financially support my open source development.

### Liberapay

[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/) is a recurring donations platform for free software projects. You can use a 
credit or debit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), a Euro bank account (SEPA Direct Debit), or a PayPal account
to donate money to me. While the goal of Liberapay is to facilitate recurring donations, by selecting 
"manual renewal" you can also make one-time donations.

### GitHub Sponsors

This is a convenient way for users of the development platform [GitHub](https://github.com/) to financially support me 
with recurring donations.

If you don't want to create a Liberapay account, you can give money using PayPal directly. Supports both one-time and
monthly donations.
